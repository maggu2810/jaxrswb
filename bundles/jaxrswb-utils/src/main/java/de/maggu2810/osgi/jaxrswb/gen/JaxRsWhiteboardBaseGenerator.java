     * <p>
     * If you would like to use the specific reference as e.g. a response of a REST entpoint or other of other code that
     * needs to serialize the object, we should prefer to use a DTO compatible data structure. Otherwise the serialized
     * object mostly looks different if different serializer implementations are used.
     * For example if you use a JAX-RS endpoint that produces JSON and a message body writer that is using Gson to
     * convert the entity to JSON, the result looks very different than using what is used by official Swagger
     * implementations (and this will result into a very strange behavior if you provide that JSON string to Swagger
     * UI).
     * So, let's build up a string-object-map and expect that this one will be nearly serialized identically regardless
     * of the chosen implementation.
     * To build that map use the mapper provided by Swagger to rely that this one is tested and working for the specific
     * reference.
